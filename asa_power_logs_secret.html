    <p>Aisha thinks my control is a 1/10. Iris thinks I'm a joke. They're wrong. I’m not "losing control"—I’m **calibrating**. I’ve been practicing in the laundry room at 3 AM when the shadows are thick enough for CJ to hide me. Here’s what I’ve found:</p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      [!] DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE EXPERIMENTS. If you feel your hair standing up, back away from the monitor.
    </div>

    <h3>1. THE "VOLT TACKLE" PROTOCOL</h3>
    <p>I was watching some old-world "Pokemon" archives on the Raspberry Pi and it clicked. If I don't just throw the lightning, but **become** the lightning, the air resistance drops to zero. </p>
    <p class="bolt-effect">> CURRENT STATUS: SUCCESSFUL.</p>
    <p>I can wrap my body in a high-frequency electrical shell and charge. I hit a brick wall in the basement at Mach 1. The wall is gone. My hoodie survived. I'm calling it the **Volt Tackle**. I haven't told Iris because she’d probably give me detention for 'property damage' or 'physics-breaking.'</p>

    <h3>2. BIO-CONDUCTIVE TELEPATHY?</h3>
    <p>I noticed that when I touch a computer, I don't just see the code—I **feel** the electrons moving. I can "hear" the server's heartbeat. I used this to "persuade" the vending machine. It wasn't an EMP; I just told the machine that the Dr. Pepper wanted to be free. It listened.</p>

    <h3>3. THE "ANDRE" FEEDBACK</h3>
    <p>Iris thinks her heart rate spikes because she's "observing" Andre. I checked the electrical signature in the air when they're near each other. It’s not just a crush—there’s a **Kinetic-Electric resonance** happening. Andre’s movement is charging my static. If I stand near them while they're flirting, I could probably power the entire school for a week. </p>

    <div class="handwriting" style="margin-top: 40px; color: #58a6ff;">
      Next step: Try to use the Volt Tackle to jump the perimeter fence. CJ says he'll catch me in the shadows if I miss.
