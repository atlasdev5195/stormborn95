        <p><strong>TIME: 22:45</strong></p>
        <p>I have attempted to "Mind-Shred" my own feelings for the third time this week. It is ineffective. The Zenith training manuals say emotion is a weakness, but Andre is... an anomaly. </p>
        
        <p>When he practiced those kinetic lunges today, I actually forgot to breathe for 4.2 seconds. I checked my vitals—my pulse was <span class="heart-monitor">128 BPM</span>. I tried to tell myself I was scanning for his "weak points," but I wasn't looking at his stance. I was looking at how the sunlight caught the back of his neck when he laughed at one of Elijah's stupid jokes.</p>
        
        <div class="asa-scribble">ASA: "SUNLIGHT CAUGHT THE BACK OF HIS NECK"?? IRIS, YOU ARE GOING FULL SHAKESPEARE ON US!! 😂</div>

        <p>I found a discarded training glove of his in the locker room. I didn't return it. I told myself it was for "DNA analysis to check for Helios nanites," but I've kept it in my top desk drawer under my scimitar sharpening kit. It smells like the cedar trees on the edge of campus and... ozone. No, that's just the smell of Asa's mistakes. It smells like him.</p>

        <div class="asa-scribble">ASA: SHE STOLE HIS GLOVE?! SHE'S A KINETIC-THIEF! 🧤</div>

        <p>I practiced saying "Hello, Andre" in the mirror for twenty minutes. I sounded like a robot. I then practiced saying "You're late for training, Andre," to sound stern, but I accidentally smiled and had to punch a hole in the wall to regain my focus. If he ever finds out I think his "kinetic flow" is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen, I will have to exile myself to the exosphere.</p>
        
        <p>I hate this. I hate him. But if he waves at me tomorrow... I think I'm going to let him see the flower hairpin again.</p>
