      <p class="timestamp">[SYSTEM TIME: 16:45:12]</p>
      <p><strong>Initial Observations:</strong> Subject is a 12-year-old female, cousin to Patient #STORM-001 (Asa Mensah). Unlike her cousin, whose cells act as a generator, Lea’s physiology functions more like a <strong>refraction lens</strong>. Initial screenings showed her abilities were 97% dormant until the "Principal’s Office Flare."</p>
      
      <p>The mutation is officially classified as <strong>Photonic Manipulation</strong>. While Asa is "The Storm," Lea is "The Star." Her cells don't just create light; they appear to absorb ambient energy and compress it into high-density plasma.</p>

      <div class="phenomenon-box lea-box">
        <h3>The "Refraction" Incident</h3>
        <p>During her first manifested event, med-bay sensors detected a localized temperature spike of 400°F within a three-inch radius of her palm. This wasn't a flashlight beam—it was a <strong>blinding white-hot sphere of unstable plasma</strong>.</p>
        <p>Most fascinating is the <strong>Proximity Trigger</strong>. Lea’s power levels spiked by 40% when Asa entered the room. They are a binary system: he provides the spark, and she provides the heat.</p>

      <h2>THE ANATOMY OF A NOVA</h2>
      <ul class="med-list">
        <li><strong>Retinal Shielding:</strong> Lea’s eyes possess a secondary, transparent membrane that flickers into place during power use to prevent self-blinding.</li>
        <li><strong>Thermal Regulation:</strong> Her skin does not burn; instead, her pores vent excess thermal energy as a faint pink mist.</li>
        <li><strong>The "Conductor" Dilemma:</strong> Subject is resistant to the Elemental Conductor Bracelet, claiming it "clashes with her outfit." Without it, her output is unfocused and highly dangerous.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>DOCTOR'S ORDERS:</h3>
      <p>1. <strong>MANDATORY BRACELET USE:</strong> Force-fit may be required via Iris. <br>
         2. <strong>Separation Exercises:</strong> Test power levels without Asa nearby. <br>
         3. <strong>Hydration:</strong> 3x water intake required to prevent "Star-Burn."</p>
