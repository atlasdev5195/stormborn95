      <h2>MEDICAL LOG – DAY 1</h2>
      <p class="timestamp">[SYSTEM TIME: 14:22:01]</p>
      <p><strong>Initial Observations:</strong> Patient arrived unconscious following a high-output discharge estimated at 85 billion joules. Subject is a 12-year-old male. Outwardly, he appears to be a standard middle-schooler with a penchant for machinery, but the internal readings are unprecedented.</p>
      
      <p>This is my first time treating a patient with <strong>Storm Affinity</strong>. Because this power set is so rare and volatile, I am logging every fluctuation. Unlike other elementalists who draw power from their environment, Asa seems to act as a living, breathing capacitor. He doesn’t just "use" electricity; his cells are actively generating a localized electromagnetic field.</p>

      <div class="phenomenon-box">
        <h3>The "Asa-Field" Phenomenon</h3>
        <p>I’ve noted that when he is nervous, the ambient air pressure in the med-bay drops by 15%. This suggests his power isn’t limited to just "bolts." He is subconsciously manipulating the atmospheric conditions around him. My healing energy (greenish-gold photonic-biological output) usually flows easily into tissue, but with Asa, I feel a "push-back." It’s like trying to pour water into a glass that’s already vibrating at 1,000Hz.</p>

      <h2>THE ANATOMY OF A STORMBORN</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Neural Overclocking:</strong> Asa’s nervous system is insulated by a specialized bio-conductive sheath. Normal human nerves would be fried by the voltage he produces. His synapses fire 10x faster than a normal human's, explaining his high energy.</li>
        <li><strong>The Mach 97 Event:</strong> He surged the transport plane by using his palm to "feed" the control panel, essentially becoming the engine. My concern is the strain on his heart; his pulse was erratic for three hours post-flight.</li>
        <li><strong>Healing Interference:</strong> His body’s natural electrical resistance resists external healing. If seriously injured, I would need to "ground" him before my energy could take effect.</li>

      <h3>DOCTOR'S ORDERS:</h3>
      <p>Patient must wear the <strong>Elemental Conductor Bracelet</strong> at all times. Risk of cellular "electrical fatigue" if he supercharges objects like his PS5.</p>
