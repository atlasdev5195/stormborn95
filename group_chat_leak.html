      <div class="msg"><span class="sender lea">Lea</span> GUYS. I just saw Iris staring at Andre for like 10 minutes straight. She didn't even notice me walk past.</div>

      <div class="msg-alt"><span class="sender asa">Asa</span> NO WAY. The ice queen is melting?? 💀 I’m currently hacking her logs... stay tuned.</div>
      
      <!-- CJ -->
      <div class="msg"><span class="sender cj">CJ</span> I’m in the shadows right now. She’s literally adjusting her hairpin and practicing a wave in the mirror. It’s physically painful to watch.</div>
      
      <!-- Elijah -->
      <div class="msg"><span class="sender elijah">Elijah</span> Has anyone seen the gym? Andre hit the punching bag so hard he literally shifted it into the next room. Iris was just standing there with her mouth open.</div>
      
      <!-- Noah -->
      <div class="msg"><span class="sender noah">Noah</span> @Elijah lol I saw that. I think she’s broken. She didn't even give him detention for it.</div>
      
      <!-- Shiloh -->
      <div class="msg"><span class="sender shiloh">Shiloh</span> ...Not again. Why does that name 'HELIOS' keep appearing in my sketches? I drew a sun yesterday but it had wires coming out of it. </div>

      <!-- Asa -->
      <div class="msg-alt"><span class="sender asa">Asa</span> @Shiloh Chill with the creepy art. I found a file in her Raspberry Pi called "A_STARE_LOG_001". It’s just 40 pages of her describing his "kinetic flow." I’m dying. 😂</div>

      <!-- Jay -->
      <div class="msg"><span class="sender jay">Jay</span> Everyone focus. We're in Mr. Sam's base. We need a plan. "Divide and Conquer," remember?</div>

      <!-- CJ -->
      <div class="msg"><span class="sender cj">CJ</span> Asa, stop sharing the battle plan in the insecure group chat! 🤦‍♂️ Also, I found a weird blinking light in the corner of the lab. Code: <span class="arg-clue">0101-IBIS</span>.</div>

      <!-- Asa -->
      <div class="msg-alt"><span class="sender asa">Asa</span> I'm entering it into the terminal now. If I disappear, tell the lunch lady I loved the pizza. 🍕</div>
