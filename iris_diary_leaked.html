        <p>I am sitting in the tech lab, and if I hear the word <span class="highlight">"GPIO pins"</span> one more time, I am going to lose my clearance for justifiable homicide.</p>
        
        <p>Asa has spent the last six hours hunched over a Raspberry Pi 5. In reality, he’s trying to bypass the firewall so he can stream high-definition videos of people <span class="highlight">power-washing driveways.</span> He turned my favorite desk lamp into a sentient strobe light. He thinks he’s a genius. I think he’s a biological hazard.</p>

        <p>I was doing my rounds near the training grounds when I saw him practicing his kinetic-shifting forms. <strong>Andre.</strong> The way he moves—it’s precise. Disciplined. Everything Asa isn't. When Andre shifted his weight to deflect a training drone, the fluid motion was… efficient. <span class="highlight">Highly efficient.</span></p>
        
        <p>However, when he caught my eye and actually waved—a standard, mid-range social gesture—my heart rate spiked to <span class="highlight">115 BPM</span>. I suspect Andre might have some sort of passive biological charm-aura that I haven't logged yet. I will need to observe him more closely. For research.</p>
